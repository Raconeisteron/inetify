#summary About Inetify

= Introduction =

Inetify is supposed to be an app to run on Andoid devices, that notifies the user when there is not internet connectivity when connected to a WiFi network.
This can be useful when the device connects automatically to a WiFi network that requires manual authentication via a website. When forgetting to do this, there will be no internet connectivity and email and other messaging services won't work without noticing it.

= Features =

The features should be something like this:

  * Test for internet connectivity should only be done when there is a WiFi connection, not for mobile connections to avoid costs.
  * Setting allowing to configure an internet server to use to test internet connectivity (i.e. by using ping or whatever is most suitable from the java.net package)
  * Setting allowing to define the SSID of a specific WiFi connection to "watch", or just any WiFi connection
  * If it is not possible for the app to receive a notification whenever a WiFi connection was established, a setting allowing to configure an interval in that the app should test if there is a WiFi connection
  * If there is no internet connectivity, there should be some not annoying notification similar to "WiFi networks available"
  * Maybe the app should run as a service?
